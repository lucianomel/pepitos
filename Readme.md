# pepitos
This is one of my first websites. I've done it in the course <a href="https://buenosaires.gob.ar/educacion/codo-codo-40">Codo a Codo</a> during 2nd semester of 2020. In it you can find a template for a food store. It's fully in spanish.
### Running the website
Clone the repository with git clone <url>. Then cd into the created folder pepitos. Then open ``index.html`` with your favourite browser, or alternatively if you have firefox installed open a terminal and run:
```bash
cd pepitos
firefox index.js
```
